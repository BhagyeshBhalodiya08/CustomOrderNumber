**Elevate Your Magento 2 Store's Order Management with the Custom Order Number Extension from Yash Web Solutions**  

Transform your Magento 2 store's default order numbers into custom, brand-aligned sequences with the powerful **Custom Order Number** extension by Yash Web Solutions. This innovative tool enables you to create and manage custom order numbers, invoices, shipments, and credit memo sequences that reflect your brand identity while simplifying transaction tracking and record-keeping.  

Our **Custom Order Number** extension goes beyond modifying numbers—it helps establish a professional and organized operational framework that builds trust with customers and sets you apart from competitors. With intuitive backend configuration, you can effortlessly define custom order patterns that include elements such as dates, store IDs, and counters, ensuring compliance with regional requirements and enhancing operational efficiency.  

### Example:  
Imagine a customer makes a purchase in March 2024. Instead of a generic number, the order ID could showcase your brand’s identity:  
**"YourBrand-ORD-2024-03-099"**  
This custom order number not only reinforces your brand but also provides clear insights into the transaction date and time, streamlining tracking and improving management.  

Invoices, shipments, and credit memos will follow the same custom format, ensuring consistency across documents. For example:  
- Invoice 1: **YourBrand-INV-2024-03-099**  
- Invoice 2: **YourBrand-INV-2024-03-099-1**  
- Shipment 1: **YourBrand-SHP-2024-03-099**  

This ensures a cohesive and professional order management system aligned with your brand.
